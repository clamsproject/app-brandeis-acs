# Evaluation plan 

## Overview 
We will evaluate speech segmentation based on discussion from [Castan et al (2015)](https://asmp-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13636-015-0076-3), which in turn uses the same evaluation metric from NIST RT project. ([RT-09 evaluation plan](https://web.archive.org/web/20161222004206if_/http://itl.nist.gov/iad/mig//tests/rt/2009/docs/rt09-meeting-eval-plan-v2.pdf)).

## Reference data
As we couldn't find a public dataset with audio mixed with speech, music, and other noise, we will annotate a small number of audio files picked from vairous collections of AAPB to create a evaluation dataset.
